                Hi guys! Do you know why am I excited? As, we're<br>
                going to Delhi! I'm going to make many<br>
                plans for this trip, and will write a NEW* Civilisation form! I<br>
                know, a new question is arising in your mind, right?<br>
                 That, what do I mean "Civilisation form"? There is a<br>
                 huge room in our relatives' house, in which we play and<br>
                 organize meetings(There are 2 reasons for organizing meetings:- <br>
                 1. To discuss the ideas etc. for the developments of the room.<br>
                 2. To give justice to a member if he is being discriminated or to raise<br>
                 his/her voice against any rule that he does not like.) We've<br>
                 named it "Masti Room". We make forms for it so that if anyone<br>
                 has filled the form, he is a member of the Masti Room. I'm planning<br>
                 to start making Excel sheets also, to keep the records of the members etc.<br><br>
                 My plans are:-<br><br>
                 Plan #1- We all will teach many things to each other e.g. coding etc.<br><br>
                 Plan #2- At Delhi, we will not everytime be gathered around any device. (Gadgets like mobiles, tablets etc.)<br><br>
                 Plan #3- If we're doing anything on any gadget except studying or any other important work, the limited time for that is not more than 10-15 minutes.<br><br>
                 Plan #4- We all will write an article/blog everyday by our creativity.
